							<h4><b>History</b></h4>
							Nashville Animal Advocacy was founded as a Meetup.com group in October 2012 by Laura Levy. Laura, a vegan and an avid animal rescuer, wanted a group to connect those who wanted to help animals with groups that needed help. Laura stepped down a year after NAA began and moved away from Nashville, but she hopes to come back, and we hope she does to! Laura passed her responsibilities to Tricia Lebkuecher, who had been co-organizing since July 2013 and a member since the first meeting. Tricia made the Facebook page in October 2013, and met her soon-to-be co-organizer, Amy Pruett in January of 2014 at a Ringling Bros. Circus protest. Amy and Tricia have run the group together ever since, and are looking ahead to incorporation as an official non-profit in the following months. Everyone in the group management is vegan and most are loving care-givers of adopted rescue animals. Our collective hope is that someday the world will be a safe and happy place for everyone, humans and animals alike.

									<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
									<h3>
										Protest Tractor Supply Co's Sale Of Easter Chicks									</h3>	
									<p>	
										Saturday, March 26 at 12:00 PM
										<br><br>
										Tractor Supply Co. is selling baby chicks for Easter this year. TSC's sign in their store claims they are not "Easter gifts," but yet the store only carries them February-April, making it seem like that is very much what they are for.										<br><br>
										Animals are NOT toys. They should not be gifts for children. Many animals gifted to children for holidays are quickly forgotten, and as a result many are either neglected or abandoned. Additionally, purchasing animals instead of adopting them leads to an increased demand for them to be bred and commodified.<br><br>
										Please join us to help let TSC customers know that animals do not make good gifts! We will be meeting in front of the Tractor Supply Co in Hendersonville on Saturday, March 26 at noon. All materials will be provided, but feel free to make your own signs if you feel so inclined.									</p>

<h3>
										Nashville Anti-Fur Protest
									</h3>	
									<p>	
										Saturday, February 13 at 12:00 PM
										<br><br>
										Nashville Animal Advocacy is protesting fur retailers in Green Hills!
										The fur industry is incredibly cruel. Modern fur most often comes from factory fur farms, where animals live in small cages and are tortured for their skins.
										<br><br>
										Nashville Animal Advocacy will be meeting in front of Regency Furs at 4113 Hillsboro Pike, Nashville, TN. All materials will be provided.
										After spending about an hour at Regency Furs, our group will walk up the road a few blocks to the Green Hills Mall to protest at that location as well. If you're coming late, please look for us there!

								<h3>
										Nashville Zoo Protest
									</h3>	
									<p>	
										Saturday, January 30 at 12:00 PM - 3:00 PM
										<br>
										Wild animals belong in the wild, not in zoos. Not only are these animals often either stolen from their parents or forcibly bred, the captivity of these wild animals can lead to severe psychological problems.
										We recently applauded the Nashville Zoo for retiring their elephants to The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, TN. However, our elation was short-lived when we found out they retired those elephants as part of a plan to acquire more animals. The elephants may likely be taken from the wild.
										<br><br>
										Please join Nashville Animal Advocacy in protesting outside the entrance to the Nashville Zoo on January 30 at 12:00 pm. All materials will be provided.
									</p>
									<h3>
										Nashville Rally for Cecil
									</h3>
									<p>											
										Saturday, February 6 at 12:00 PM
										<br>
										Join the Nashville Rally For Cecil and speak out against evil trophy hunting!
										<br><br>
										To obtain more information about the Worldwide Rally For Cecil, please visit <a href="http://www.cwint.org/rallyforcecil" target="_blank">www.cwint.org/rallyforcecil</a>.</p>
									<h3>
										Volunteer at the Pig Preserve
									</h3>	
									<p>
										Saturday, November 14, 8:30 am to 6:30 pm
										<br>
										The Pig Preserve, located in Jamestown, TN , is a pig sanctuary dedicated to caring for pigs from all walks of life. It is exceptional among pig sanctuaries because they try to offer as much freedom and autonomy for their pigs as possible, giving them more space per pig than many other sanctuaries.
										<br><br>
										We will be carpooling from Nashville at 8:30 am, and arriving at the Pig Preserve around 10:30 or 11. We will meet at 1700 State St., Nashville, TN, or we can pick people up if necessary. If you are worried about your car being left on the street, parking is available in a locked garage at the address listed. If you would rather meet us at the Pig Preserve, it's located at 199 Ike Blevins Jr. Road, Jamestown, TN 38556.
										Please be aware that this event may be cancelled or moved due to weather conditions, so please be on the lookout!
										<br><br>
										Check out the Pig Preserve's website! <a href="http://www.thepigpreserve.org/">thepigpreserve.org</a>
									</p>									
									<h3>
										Fur Free Friday (Protest at Regency Furs)
									</h3>
									<p>
										Friday, November 27, 12 pm
										<br>
										Fur Free Friday is an international day of protest and disruption against the cruel fur industry. Join Nashville Animal Advocacy as we partner with several national orgs including Last Chance for Animals, In Defense of Animals, and PETA to hold our event here in Nashville!
										<br><br>
										Nashville Animal Advocacy will be meeting in front of Regency Furs at 4113 Hillsboro Pike, Nashville, TN. All materials will be provided.
										<br><br>
										Please be aware that traffic will be incredibly heavy in the Green Hills area on the day of this protest (Black Friday), so please plan to leave early to be able to get there!
									</p>
									<h3>
										Protest Whole Foods
									</h3>
									<p>
										Saturday, October 24 10:30 am to 1 pm
										<br>
										Tell Whole Foods customers that there is no such thing as "humane" meat!
										<br><br>
										Following a damning PETA investigation of a Whole Foods "happy meat" pork supplier, protests have errupted accross the country. The customers of Whole Foods have a right to know that meat from Whole Foods is not cruelty free, as Whole Foods would lead you to believe.
										<br><br>
										Pigs at a "Step 2" pork supplier (rated more highly than most of Whole Foods' pork suppliers) were "confined to crowded sheds with concrete floors," "went without adequate veterinary care for days or even weeks," and "workers hit pigs who were being loaded for slaughter." (Source: PETA)
										<br><br>
										Just to be clear, we are not calling for a boycott of Whole Foods. Instead, we are encouraging customers to buy the ONLY type of "humane meat" available: Vegan meat alternatives.
										<br><br>
										Please join us on Saturday, October 24 at 10:30 AM to inform the public of Whole Foods' gross misrepresentation of their "humane" standards.

								<h2>We Are Not Gifts!</h2>
								<p>By Ashley Roth, Communications Specialist</p>
								<h4>March 22, 2016</h4>
						<p>Easter is soaked in springtime symbolism. It's a holiday inundated with remnants of the 

Pagan holiday Ostara. Kids run through backyards and parks, searching for plastic eggs 

(because chicken eggs aren't for humans, remember?). They gobble up jelly beans and 

chocolate hollow bunnies. They wear pastels. Little hands dig through baskets, and reach in for 

their new favorite toy: a plush bunny, duck, or fuzzy chick. The most crucial aspect of this scene 

is that their new furry friend is a toy--as in made from cloth and stuffing and no vital organs 

inside. Because live animals are not commodities--and should never be a gift from the Easter 

Bunny.</p>

<p>Sadly, some Easter Bunnies are uneducated and do this very thing. It's unfortunate that 

many find the need to buy chocolate laden with cow's milk, or that they support the egg industry 

for some glorified art project. News flash: there are vegan options, even for dyeing eggs. 

Parents can craft their own egg substitutes, or buy EggNots. As for the live animals--this 

shouldn't have to be explained. But it does.</p>

<p>Every year too many kids wake up and find a living, breathing creature nestled in plastic 

grass. On that day, this creature is cute. The little chirps are a welcome background to an egg 

hunt. Baby bunnies make for adorable social media posts. Everyone can collectively "ooh" and 

"ah". Then there's the day after Easter. And the day after that.

Baby animals grow up. They have daily care requirements. They may have special diets, 

or feeding demands. Often these gifted animals need particular enclosures for their safety, and 

maybe have specific temperature needs. Rarely, do excited parents plan for the future 

reality--all because they began thinking of this animal as a purchased object, rather than a 

someone.</p>

<p>Parents, do you get a dog on a whim? Or a cat? Usually, you discuss it as a family and 

plan on walks and litter duty. These same rules should apply here. Small animals often have 

more intricate care needs than the domesticated animals most are used to--and they aren't 

babies forever. When you don't think or talk about real life, or educate yourself on these Easter-

themed animals--their lives are in peril. Let me tell you what happens.

They are discarded, like any other worn plaything. Shelters are the best outcome for 

these tossed animals. 80 percent of all rabbits at shelters were once cuddly Easter gifts, and 

now they're on death row hoping that a true bunny lover happens to rescue them. And the 

chickens and ducks--well, how many people are searching shelters for them? What if parents 

return these animals to the feed store, or the pet store? Chickens and ducks will be thrust into 

the farming assembly line, either to produce more commodities or to be turned into food. 

Rabbits will be shoved back into a tiny glass enclosure. There, they wait for chance. These 

aren't made of plastic or cloth; they are living, breathing animals who feel and should never be 

treated like trash.</p>

<p>Rabbits are fragile and may be harmed by children who don't mean to be rough. They 

enjoy chewing and need to be protected from wires, and your chewable valuables need to be 

protected from them. Their dietary needs are specific--including grass hay and two cups of 

vegetables. Rabbits have incredibly sensitive digestive systems. Any sudden food changes, and 

a toxic--and potentially fatal--bacteria may flourish in a rabbit's intestines. That isn't the only 

ailment rabbits are prone to. They can be infested with mites; their teeth may become 

overgrown; and they are very susceptible to heatstroke. Rabbits can be excellent companions, 

but their care is complicated--much more complicated than any toy given in a woven basket.</p>

<p>Then, there are chickens. Once the softest of chicks, they quickly grow into hens or 

roosters with their own list of demands. As tiny chicks, they are delicate and can die from being 

handled incorrectly. Chickens have dietary needs specific to their age and gender--their human 

caregivers need to know the differences in calcium and protein. They also need to know that 

avocados can make chickens very sick. For housing, chickens need a clean and safe coop with 

room for exercise and dust to bathe in. Chickens need to be thoroughly examined every day. 

They are vulnerable to a slew of viruses and parasites. Oh, yeah--chickens sometimes become 

infected with salmonella. A disease that can make them and your human children come down 

with a messy, uncomfortable illness. Think about that before you place a little chick next to the 

chocolate bunny. You know they make really cute motorized toys that look just like 

chicks--salmonella free!</p>

<p>Oh, and ducks. Sure, the kids loved their duckling and swore to love him forever--but, 

then it's May and they're bored with him. And parents? They're sick of cleaning up after him and 

making sure his basic needs are met. Thankfully, he's wild! And can go back to a serene pond 

with all his duck friends. Wrong. While 98 percent of gifted ducks are dumped by a pond or 

creek, or at a park--it doesn't make it right. This duck you gave to your kid is domesticated, and 

thrusting him into the wild is going to kill him. He won't know how to fend off predators and other 

ducks may reject him. He won't know innate behaviors of wild ducks, because he isn't wild. So, 

before you kill this "Easter gift," educate yourself and your kids on duck care. See if everyone is 

willing to actively engage, clean, and be diligent about a duck-friendly diet (no bread!). If not, 

ducks aren't for you. And they're NEVER for an Easter basket.</p>

<p>Maybe someone reading this is up to the challenge of rescuing these animals and is 

more than devoted to their care. That's great--it still doesn't justify them as Easter gifts. By 

purchasing these animals, you are telling your children and yourself they are just a commodity. 

If a child truly expresses interest in rescuing an animal, have long conversations about care and 

responsibility--let them talk to others who have these animals as companions. And, then, 

actually rescue them. Don't support pet stores or feed stores that are celebrating the 

exploitation of animals--who don't care if you dump them when you're through with them. 

Because they already made their profit.</p>

<p>Nashville, here's where you come in. Obviously, after reading this you have no intention 

of gifting live animals to your children. You should share your awareness. Did you know we have 

local feed stores selling baby chicks? Davidson Co-Op is selling them for a mere three dollars. 

Parents won't bat an eye paying that--and probably won't think much of dumping them after 

either. Please go to these stores and educate sellers, educate potential buyers. Tell your friends. 

Share on Facebook. Tell them about Nashville's Bunny Rescue and Clover Patch if they are 

really serious about becoming rabbit-parents. Bunnies can be rescued all year long--just not on

										Vegan Book Club
									</h3>
									<p>
									Monday, February 1, 6:30 PM
									<br><br>
									This meet-up has been scheduled for the first week of February to give people time to find the book at their local library or order The Companion Species Manifesto Dogs, People and Significant Otherness by Donna Haraway It's a small easy-to-read book that will get us thinking about compassion in 2016. We will also vote on which books and in what order we'd like to cover them over the next year so that everyone can have time to plan while enjoying vegan lattes and mochas.

										Annual Vegan Thanksgiving Feast

										<br><br>
										Lion's Head Condominiums are located in West Nashville just off of White Bridge Rd. The Lion's Head Club House is a great space with plenty of room. It has a kitchen with plates, silverware, a stove, and microwave if you need to warm your dish. 
										<br><br>
										$2 per person, to cover the cost of the room.
