							<h4><b>History</b></h4>
							Nashville Animal Advocacy was founded as a Meetup.com group in October 2012 by Laura Levy. Laura, a vegan and an avid animal rescuer, wanted a group to connect those who wanted to help animals with groups that needed help. Laura stepped down a year after NAA began and moved away from Nashville, but she hopes to come back, and we hope she does too! Laura passed her responsibilities to Tricia Lebkuecher, who had been co-organizing since July 2013 and a member since the first meeting. Tricia made the Facebook page in October 2013, and met her soon-to-be co-organizer, Amy Pruett in January of 2014 at a Ringling Bros. Circus protest. Amy and Tricia have run the group together ever since, and are looking ahead to incorporation as an official non-profit in the following months. Everyone in the group management is vegan and most are loving care-givers of adopted rescue animals. Our collective hope is that someday the world will be a safe and happy place for everyone, humans and animals alike.

									<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
									<h3>
										Protest The Iroquois Steeplechase
									</h3>	
									<p>	
										Saturday, May 14 at 11:00 AM
										<br><br>
										The appropiatively-named Iroquois Steeplechase (which has nothing to do with the actual Iroquois Peoples) is a horrific horse racing event in our community where horses race while jumping over obstacles (as opposed to flat racing).
										<br><br>
										On average, 24 horses die per week in the horse racing industry—over 1,200 a year. Only 5-10% of horses bred for racing ever see a track, and the "rejects" are sent often to slaughter along with "retired" racehorses. In many cases, if a horse fails to bring their "owners" a profit after 3 major races, they also will be sent to slaughter. Very few racehorses are ever retired to pastures.
										<br><br>
										Please join Nashville Animal Advocacy Saturday, May 14th at 11 am to protest the horric Iroquois Steeplechase in their 75th year of promoting animal cruelty. All materials will be provided.

										Friday, May 20 at 6:00 PM
										Saturday, May 21 at 6:00 PM
										<br><br>
										Rodeos are cruel and dangerous events for the animals involved. The Franklin Rodeo claims the rodeo to be a family fun event, where children are allowed to participate in chasing terrified baby animals and cowboys perform harmful and violent acts against animals.
										<br><br>
										Please join us to be a voice for those tortured, abused and even killed by the rodeo. We will protest all 3 nights of the rodeo from 6-7 pm.
										<br><br>

									<h3>
										Nashville Zoo Protest
									</h3>	
									<p>	
										Saturday, April 30 at 12:00 PM
										<br><br>
										Wild animals belong in the wild, not in zoos. Not only are these animals often either stolen from their parents or forcibly bred, the captivity of these wild animals can lead to severe psychological problems.
										<br><br>
										We recently applauded the Nashville Zoo for retiring their elephants to The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, TN. However, our elation was short-lived when we found out they retired those elephants as part of a plan to acquire more animals. The elephants may likely be taken from the wild.
										<br><br>
										Let's show the zoo that Nashvillians do not approve of animal captivity! Please join Nashville Animal Advocacy in protesting outside the entrance to the Nashville Zoo on Saturday, April 30 at 12 pm. All materials will be provided.
										<br><br>
										Please also sign our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.change.org/p/nashville-mayor-megan-barry-stop-the-nashville-zoo-from-acquiring-new-animals?recruiter=7604646&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink">petition</a> to keep the Nashville Zoo from acquiring new elephants.

									<h3>
										Protest Tractor Supply Co's Sale Of Easter Chicks									</h3>	
									<p>	
										Saturday, March 26 at 12:00 PM
										<br><br>
										Tractor Supply Co. is selling baby chicks for Easter this year. TSC's sign in their store claims they are not "Easter gifts," but yet the store only carries them February-April, making it seem like that is very much what they are for.										<br><br>
										Animals are NOT toys. They should not be gifts for children. Many animals gifted to children for holidays are quickly forgotten, and as a result many are either neglected or abandoned. Additionally, purchasing animals instead of adopting them leads to an increased demand for them to be bred and commodified.<br><br>
										Please join us to help let TSC customers know that animals do not make good gifts! We will be meeting in front of the Tractor Supply Co in Hendersonville on Saturday, March 26 at noon. All materials will be provided, but feel free to make your own signs if you feel so inclined.									</p>
									Nashville Anti-Fur Protest
									</h3>	
									<p>	
										Saturday, February 13 at 12:00 PM
										<br><br>
										Nashville Animal Advocacy is protesting fur retailers in Green Hills!
										The fur industry is incredibly cruel. Modern fur most often comes from factory fur farms, where animals live in small cages and are tortured for their skins.
										<br><br>
										Nashville Animal Advocacy will be meeting in front of Regency Furs at 4113 Hillsboro Pike, Nashville, TN. All materials will be provided.
										After spending about an hour at Regency Furs, our group will walk up the road a few blocks to the Green Hills Mall to protest at that location as well. If you're coming late, please look for us there!

										Saturday, January 30 at 12:00 PM - 3:00 PM
										<br>
										Wild animals belong in the wild, not in zoos. Not only are these animals often either stolen from their parents or forcibly bred, the captivity of these wild animals can lead to severe psychological problems.

										Volunteer at the Pig Preserve
									</h3>	
									<p>
										Saturday, November 14, 8:30 am to 6:30 pm
										<br>
										The Pig Preserve, located in Jamestown, TN , is a pig sanctuary dedicated to caring for pigs from all walks of life. It is exceptional among pig sanctuaries because they try to offer as much freedom and autonomy for their pigs as possible, giving them more space per pig than many other sanctuaries.
										<br><br>
										We will be carpooling from Nashville at 8:30 am, and arriving at the Pig Preserve around 10:30 or 11. We will meet at 1700 State St., Nashville, TN, or we can pick people up if necessary. If you are worried about your car being left on the street, parking is available in a locked garage at the address listed. If you would rather meet us at the Pig Preserve, it's located at 199 Ike Blevins Jr. Road, Jamestown, TN 38556.
										Please be aware that this event may be cancelled or moved due to weather conditions, so please be on the lookout!
										<br><br>
										Check out the Pig Preserve's website! <a href="http://www.thepigpreserve.org/">thepigpreserve.org</a>

									</h3>
									<p>
										Friday, November 27, 12 pm

										Protest Whole Foods
									</h3>
									<p>
										Saturday, October 24 10:30 am to 1 pm
										<br>
										Tell Whole Foods customers that there is no such thing as "humane" meat!
										<br><br>
										Following a damning PETA investigation of a Whole Foods "happy meat" pork supplier, protests have errupted accross the country. The customers of Whole Foods have a right to know that meat from Whole Foods is not cruelty free, as Whole Foods would lead you to believe.
										<br><br>
										Pigs at a "Step 2" pork supplier (rated more highly than most of Whole Foods' pork suppliers) were "confined to crowded sheds with concrete floors," "went without adequate veterinary care for days or even weeks," and "workers hit pigs who were being loaded for slaughter." (Source: PETA)
										<br><br>
										Just to be clear, we are not calling for a boycott of Whole Foods. Instead, we are encouraging customers to buy the ONLY type of "humane meat" available: Vegan meat alternatives.
										<br><br>
										Please join us on Saturday, October 24 at 10:30 AM to inform the public of Whole Foods' gross misrepresentation of their "humane" standards.

								<h2>Zoos Are No Fun For Animals</h2>
								<p>By Ashley Roth, Communications Specialist</p>
								<h4>April 18, 2016</h4>
								<p> Activists cheered when the plight of captive animals was brought into mainstream 

discourse. 2013's BlackFish veered these thoughts and questions into the public eye. The 

documentary shocked audiences, showing them how their beloved Shamu truly lived. After its 

release SeaWorld's stock dropped 30%. SeaWorld refuted the film's claims in their desperate 

television ads; they promised bigger fish bowls. The public wasn't buying it. 

The film's message speaks beyond SeaWorld and orcas: Animals in captivity experience 

devastating psychosis. After the film, society began looking at zoos through a new, scrutinizing 

lens. NPR has aired several segments debating the cruelty of zoos; TIME magazine had an entire 

issue devoted to animal intelligence; and Huffington Post and the Guardian have numerous 

articles discussing the subject. </p>

<p> Being that this is a group based on animal advocacy, our stance on the subject is probably 

quite clear. BlackFish portrayed an orca's insanity in captivity. Zoos hold their own instances. 

There was Gus the polar bear. Slate.com documents his repetitive figure-eight swimming, often 

for over twelve hours straight. Little Joe, a teenage gorilla, escaped from the Franklin Park Zoo 

in 2003. His frantic run for freedom resulted in injuries before he was shot with a tranquilizer 

gun. Other escaped prisoners were not merely tranquilized. PETA has a memorable video titled, "9 

Animals Driven Insane." The clip shows animals suffering from zoochosis. Pacing, circling, 

swaying, and self-injury are portrayed through actual footage of animals in captivity. Bill Travers   

conceived this term--zoochosis--to explain the compulsive, recurring behaviors of captive 

animals. If you've been to a zoo, you've seen these behaviors. You've seen a lion pacing, an 

elephant swaying, or a bear walking in repeated circles.</p>

<p>Zoos beget these behaviors by forcing nature into unnatural conditions. Their enclosures 

are too small. In the wild, elephants walk thirty miles a day. No fancy zoo enclosure is conducive 

to this.  Their environments can't duplicate nature. Animals are shoved into smaller spaces when 

the weather is acrimonious to their biological needs. Other animals--such as polar bears in 

California--are given artificial climates. Some patrons cause further stress by taunting animals. 

The lifespan in captivity is disparate from a life in the wild. Wild elephants can live up to seventy 

years; most captive elephants are dead by forty. </p>

<p>Animals are unhappy in captivity. Captive chimpanzees are ripped from their mothers at 

an early age; in the wild baby chimps are inseparable from their mothers until about seven years 

of age. Penguins at Scarborough Sea Life Centre are on antidepressants. Zoos enforce the notion 

that animals are mere commodities. Remember Marius the giraffe? He was killed because that 

zoo felt they had too many giraffes. Even his dismembered body was on display, as he was fed to 

lions in front of small children. Some zoos sell their "surplus" animals to random buyers, 

traveling circuses, or medical labs. These are business built on atrocities that are not benefitting 

animals. </p>

<p>Zoos will tell you they are necessary--the key to conservation and education. Efforts for 

"conservation" would serve the wild better. Zoos "conservation" operates under the concept that if 

a species goes extinct, the zoo animals can be released back into the wild. This has been proven 

unsuccessful--the zoo population is limited, often inbred; and these captive animals are not 

immune to wild diseases and conditions. Why not ensure the wild population is secure, rather 

than relying on human-controlled "wildlife?" Besides,  more often than not, zoos money is spent 

on technology and showier exhibits--not on conservation. Their concern is how secure their 

finances are. What about education?  Learning from the enslaved is wrong, first off, and few are 

being educated. Rarely do people read the little plaques containing pithy information. Crowds 

surrounding the enclosures are often dense, and obstructing of views. And any view is of an 

animal suffering from artificial conditions, probably from zoochosis. This "learning" experience 

is problematic. It's false.  Better education would be obtained through books and videos and 

catching animals in their natural habitat. The bottom line is even IF zoos were supporting 

conservation and children were learning something, it is wrong. Zoos are for human 

consumerism, not for animals' benefit. These animals would probably rather be extinct than 

suffering. </p>

<p> Now, here's where it gets personal. Many readers are probably Nashvillians (this is a 

Nashville based animal advocacy group, after all!). Maybe some of you are thinking: "Sure, these 

other places are awful--but not our beloved Nashville Zoo!" Even with the illusion of pretty 

enclosures and clean parks--yes, even the Nashville Zoo. 

Recently, our city heralded the Nashville Zoo's decision to send their elephants to the 

Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald. This decision made the zoo appear progressive, like they 

were suddenly enlightened and realized zoos were becoming dated. That isn't the case. These 

elephants were removed because they'd exceeded their use--they were old and the zoo was 

planning several renovations. This elephant herd was separated before the donation--Juno sent 

to Florida, where she died from an "undetected intestinal disease."  The other three were ferried 

to the sanctuary, so the Nashville Zoo could resume their vision for a larger elephant exhibit. In 

fact, they plan to expand their entire facility--culminating by 2020. Expansion means more 

animals behind bars. Animals either bred for this heinous existence, or ripped from the wild. 

Concerning the elephants, that plan is said to be on hold--but, in their own words, "our vision is 

to eventually have a growing elephant herd." </p>

<p>Other animals are part of this plan. Young tigers are forthcoming--the old ones being 

sent to Tiger Haven, another marketing ploy to appear compassionate--and they are thrilled to 

be imprisoning white rhinos in the vacated elephant exhibit, stating they will be "a valuable start 

to our rhino collection." Our local zoo is not paralleling society's growing awareness. They still 

refer to this living beings as a "collection."</p>

<p> Nashvillians, please stop supporting this business. Sign our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.change.org/p/nashville-mayor-megan-barry-stop-the-nashville-zoo-from-acquiring-new-animals?recruiter=7604646&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink">petition</a> to stop the Nashville 

Zoo from acquiring more elephants. Nashville parents, take your kids to see our own beautiful 

indigenous wildlife.  I've taken my daughter to our stunning parks and we've seen herons, a 

variety of ducks, and deer. Seeing them makes her excited--and they're free to live their lives 

without human control. If you or your children want to see other animals, travel. There are other 

options. Compassionate ones.</p>
<p>Please consider joining our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/228255424195733/">protest</a> of the Nashville Zoo on Saturday, April 30th at noon. All materials will be provided.</p><br><br>

								<h2>We Are Not Gifts!</h2>
								<p>By Ashley Roth, Communications Specialist</p>
								<h4>March 22, 2016</h4>
						<p>Easter is soaked in springtime symbolism. It's a holiday inundated with remnants of the 

Pagan holiday Ostara. Kids run through backyards and parks, searching for plastic eggs 

(because chicken eggs aren't for humans, remember?). They gobble up jelly beans and 

chocolate hollow bunnies. They wear pastels. Little hands dig through baskets, and reach in for 

their new favorite toy: a plush bunny, duck, or fuzzy chick. The most crucial aspect of this scene 

is that their new furry friend is a toy--as in made from cloth and stuffing and no vital organs 

inside. Because live animals are not commodities--and should never be a gift from the Easter 

Bunny.</p>

<p>Sadly, some Easter Bunnies are uneducated and do this very thing. It's unfortunate that 

many find the need to buy chocolate laden with cow's milk, or that they support the egg industry 

for some glorified art project. News flash: there are vegan options, even for dyeing eggs. 

Parents can craft their own egg substitutes, or buy EggNots. As for the live animals--this 

shouldn't have to be explained. But it does.</p>

<p>Every year too many kids wake up and find a living, breathing creature nestled in plastic 

grass. On that day, this creature is cute. The little chirps are a welcome background to an egg 

hunt. Baby bunnies make for adorable social media posts. Everyone can collectively "ooh" and 

"ah". Then there's the day after Easter. And the day after that.

Baby animals grow up. They have daily care requirements. They may have special diets, 

or feeding demands. Often these gifted animals need particular enclosures for their safety, and 

maybe have specific temperature needs. Rarely, do excited parents plan for the future 

reality--all because they began thinking of this animal as a purchased object, rather than a 

someone.</p>

<p>Parents, do you get a dog on a whim? Or a cat? Usually, you discuss it as a family and 

plan on walks and litter duty. These same rules should apply here. Small animals often have 

more intricate care needs than the domesticated animals most are used to--and they aren't 

babies forever. When you don't think or talk about real life, or educate yourself on these Easter-

themed animals--their lives are in peril. Let me tell you what happens.

They are discarded, like any other worn plaything. Shelters are the best outcome for 

these tossed animals. 80 percent of all rabbits at shelters were once cuddly Easter gifts, and 

now they're on death row hoping that a true bunny lover happens to rescue them. And the 

chickens and ducks--well, how many people are searching shelters for them? What if parents 

return these animals to the feed store, or the pet store? Chickens and ducks will be thrust into 

the farming assembly line, either to produce more commodities or to be turned into food. 

Rabbits will be shoved back into a tiny glass enclosure. There, they wait for chance. These 

aren't made of plastic or cloth; they are living, breathing animals who feel and should never be 

treated like trash.</p>

<p>Rabbits are fragile and may be harmed by children who don't mean to be rough. They 

enjoy chewing and need to be protected from wires, and your chewable valuables need to be 

protected from them. Their dietary needs are specific--including grass hay and two cups of 

vegetables. Rabbits have incredibly sensitive digestive systems. Any sudden food changes, and 

a toxic--and potentially fatal--bacteria may flourish in a rabbit's intestines. That isn't the only 

ailment rabbits are prone to. They can be infested with mites; their teeth may become 

overgrown; and they are very susceptible to heatstroke. Rabbits can be excellent companions, 

but their care is complicated--much more complicated than any toy given in a woven basket.</p>

<p>Then, there are chickens. Once the softest of chicks, they quickly grow into hens or 

roosters with their own list of demands. As tiny chicks, they are delicate and can die from being 

handled incorrectly. Chickens have dietary needs specific to their age and gender--their human 

caregivers need to know the differences in calcium and protein. They also need to know that 

avocados can make chickens very sick. For housing, chickens need a clean and safe coop with 

room for exercise and dust to bathe in. Chickens need to be thoroughly examined every day. 

They are vulnerable to a slew of viruses and parasites. Oh, yeah--chickens sometimes become 

infected with salmonella. A disease that can make them and your human children come down 

with a messy, uncomfortable illness. Think about that before you place a little chick next to the 

chocolate bunny. You know they make really cute motorized toys that look just like 

chicks--salmonella free!</p>

<p>Oh, and ducks. Sure, the kids loved their duckling and swore to love him forever--but, 

then it's May and they're bored with him. And parents? They're sick of cleaning up after him and 

making sure his basic needs are met. Thankfully, he's wild! And can go back to a serene pond 

with all his duck friends. Wrong. While 98 percent of gifted ducks are dumped by a pond or 

creek, or at a park--it doesn't make it right. This duck you gave to your kid is domesticated, and 

thrusting him into the wild is going to kill him. He won't know how to fend off predators and other 

ducks may reject him. He won't know innate behaviors of wild ducks, because he isn't wild. So, 

before you kill this "Easter gift," educate yourself and your kids on duck care. See if everyone is 

willing to actively engage, clean, and be diligent about a duck-friendly diet (no bread!). If not, 

ducks aren't for you. And they're NEVER for an Easter basket.</p>

<p>Maybe someone reading this is up to the challenge of rescuing these animals and is 

more than devoted to their care. That's great--it still doesn't justify them as Easter gifts. By 

purchasing these animals, you are telling your children and yourself they are just a commodity. 

If a child truly expresses interest in rescuing an animal, have long conversations about care and 

responsibility--let them talk to others who have these animals as companions. And, then, 

actually rescue them. Don't support pet stores or feed stores that are celebrating the 

exploitation of animals--who don't care if you dump them when you're through with them. 

Because they already made their profit.</p>

<p>Nashville, here's where you come in. Obviously, after reading this you have no intention 

of gifting live animals to your children. You should share your awareness. Did you know we have 

local feed stores selling baby chicks? Davidson Co-Op is selling them for a mere three dollars. 

Parents won't bat an eye paying that--and probably won't think much of dumping them after 

either. Please go to these stores and educate sellers, educate potential buyers. Tell your friends. 

Share on Facebook. Tell them about Nashville's Bunny Rescue and Clover Patch if they are 

really serious about becoming rabbit-parents. Bunnies can be rescued all year long--just not on 

Easter. That day should be reserved for veganizing Cadbury Eggs and reading Peter Rabbit.</p><br><br><br><br>
