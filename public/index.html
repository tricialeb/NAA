							<h3>About Us</h3>
							Nashville Animal Advocacy was founded as a Meetup.com group in October 2012 by Laura Levy. Laura, a vegan and an avid animal rescuer, wanted a group to connect those who wanted to help animals with groups that needed help. Laura stepped down a year after NAA began and moved away from Nashville, but she hopes to come back, and we hope she does to! Laura passed her responsibilities to Tricia Lebkuecher, who had been co-organizing since July 2013 and a member since the first meeting. Tricia made the Facebook page in October 2013, and met her soon-to-be co-organizer, Amy Pruett in January of 2014 at a Ringling Bros. Circus protest. Amy and Tricia have run the group together ever since, and are looking ahead to incorporation as an official non-profit in the following months. Everyone in the group management is vegan and most are loving care-givers of adopted rescue animals. Our collective hope is that someday the world will be a safe and happy place for everyone, humans and animals alike.

									<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
									<h3>
										Nashville Zoo Protest
									</h3>	
									<p>	
										Saturday, January 30 at 12:00 PM - 3:00 PM
										<br>
										Wild animals belong in the wild, not in zoos. Not only are these animals often either stolen from their parents or forcibly bred, the captivity of these wild animals can lead to severe psychological problems.
										We recently applauded the Nashville Zoo for retiring their elephants to The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, TN. However, our elation was short-lived when we found out they retired those elephants as part of a plan to acquire more animals. The elephants may likely be taken from the wild.
										<br><br>
										Please join Nashville Animal Advocacy in protesting outside the entrance to the Nashville Zoo on January 23 at 12:30 pm. All materials will be provided.
									</p>
									<br><br><p class="lead"> RSVP on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/450402668489617/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></p>

										Volunteer at the Pig Preserve
									</h3>	
									<p>
										Saturday, November 14, 8:30 am to 6:30 pm
										<br>
										The Pig Preserve, located in Jamestown, TN , is a pig sanctuary dedicated to caring for pigs from all walks of life. It is exceptional among pig sanctuaries because they try to offer as much freedom and autonomy for their pigs as possible, giving them more space per pig than many other sanctuaries.
										<br><br>
										We will be carpooling from Nashville at 8:30 am, and arriving at the Pig Preserve around 10:30 or 11. We will meet at 1700 State St., Nashville, TN, or we can pick people up if necessary. If you are worried about your car being left on the street, parking is available in a locked garage at the address listed. If you would rather meet us at the Pig Preserve, it's located at 199 Ike Blevins Jr. Road, Jamestown, TN 38556.
										Please be aware that this event may be cancelled or moved due to weather conditions, so please be on the lookout!
										<br><br>
										Check out the Pig Preserve's website! <a href="http://www.thepigpreserve.org/">thepigpreserve.org</a>

									<h3>
										Fur Free Friday (Protest at Regency Furs)
									</h3>
									<p>
										Friday, November 27, 12 pm
										<br>
										Fur Free Friday is an international day of protest and disruption against the cruel fur industry. Join Nashville Animal Advocacy as we partner with several national orgs including Last Chance for Animals, In Defense of Animals, and PETA to hold our event here in Nashville!
										<br><br>
										Nashville Animal Advocacy will be meeting in front of Regency Furs at 4113 Hillsboro Pike, Nashville, TN. All materials will be provided.
										<br><br>
										Please be aware that traffic will be incredibly heavy in the Green Hills area on the day of this protest (Black Friday), so please plan to leave early to be able to get there!

									<h3>
										Protest Whole Foods
									</h3>
									<p>
										Saturday, October 24 10:30 am to 1 pm
										<br>
										Tell Whole Foods customers that there is no such thing as "humane" meat!
										<br><br>
										Following a damning PETA investigation of a Whole Foods "happy meat" pork supplier, protests have errupted accross the country. The customers of Whole Foods have a right to know that meat from Whole Foods is not cruelty free, as Whole Foods would lead you to believe.
										<br><br>
										Pigs at a "Step 2" pork supplier (rated more highly than most of Whole Foods' pork suppliers) were "confined to crowded sheds with concrete floors," "went without adequate veterinary care for days or even weeks," and "workers hit pigs who were being loaded for slaughter." (Source: PETA)
										<br><br>
										Just to be clear, we are not calling for a boycott of Whole Foods. Instead, we are encouraging customers to buy the ONLY type of "humane meat" available: Vegan meat alternatives.
										<br><br>
										Please join us on Saturday, October 24 at 10:30 AM to inform the public of Whole Foods' gross misrepresentation of their "humane" standards.
